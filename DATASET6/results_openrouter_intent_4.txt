Hmm, the user is asking for 10 continuation citations in the style of academic writing, specifically in probability theory. The examples provided show patterns where citations extend previous work, either by building on methods, comparing results, or providing additional applications.

Okay, need to generate citations that follow similar structures. The citations should start with @@CITATION and be placed at the beginning of the sentence. The content should reflect probability theory, so topics like stochastic processes, Bayesian methods, and statistical inference would be relevant.

First, I'll brainstorm some common areas in probability theory where extensions are frequent: Martingale theory, Markov processes, Bayesian inference, extreme value theory, etc. Each citation should logically continue from existing work, either by refining methods, applying them to new domains, or combining approaches.

For example, a citation might extend the work on Lévy processes by applying them to finance, or build on Bayesian nonparametrics for machine learning. The phrasing should mirror the examples, using connectors like "extended the framework," "built upon," or "further developed."

I'll vary the structures to match the examples—some citations might standalone, while others are part of lists or comparisons.

Hmm, the user has provided a clear task: generate 10 continuation citations in the style of theoretical astronomy, following the given examples. The citations should extend existing data, methods, or concepts, and be placed mid-sentence with the @@CITATION marker.

Okay, first I need to understand the pattern. The examples show that continuation citations either build on prior work, introduce a new application, or refine existing methods. The citations are seamlessly integrated into the sentence, often as part of a list or as a direct reference.

As an associate professor in theoretical astronomy, I should focus on topics like dark matter, galaxy formation, cosmic microwave background, etc. The citations should sound plausible and academic, with authors and years that fit the field.

Let me brainstorm some common research areas where extensions are frequent:
- Dark matter simulations (extending to velocity-dependent interactions)
- Galaxy formation models (adding AGN feedback)
- CMB analysis (improving foreground subtraction)
- Stellar population synthesis (refining IMF assumptions)
- Gravitational wave astronomy (extending waveform models)
- Exoplanet detection (improving atmospheric retrieval)

Each citation should feel like a natural progression from prior work. I'll structure them to mirror the examples, using phrases like "extended by," "building on," or "incorporating" to show continuity. The @@CITATION placeholder should appear where the reference logically fits in the sentence.

I'll also vary the placement—sometimes in a list, sometimes as a standalone reference—to match the diversity in the examples. The goal is to make each citation feel authentic and contextually appropriate for theoretical astronomy.Of course. As an Associate Professor specializing in Theoretical Astronomy, here are 10 continuation citations that build upon existing data, methods, and concepts within the field.

The iconography of the "World Upside-Down" (*mundus inversus*) in broadsheet prints has been well documented for its satirical and social-critical functions, but its adaptation in colonial contexts to express subaltern resistance, as @@CITATION demonstrates through an analysis of hybrid Andean-Spanish motifs, reveals a more complex and politically charged dimension.

8.  In contrast to the text-heavy approach of traditional emblem studies, a more image-centric methodology is needed, one that prioritizes the visual logic of combinatorial figures and their reception, a path forward suggested by @@CITATION in their cognitive analysis of how viewers decode allegorical compositions.
9.  The pervasive iconography of the *Vierge ouvrante* in late medieval sculpture, with its Marian figure containing a miniature Trinity within, has been studied for its theological complexity, but its function as a mnemonic device for lay meditation is a compelling interpretation advanced by @@CITATION, linking specific interior scenes to popular devotional texts.
10. While Warburg's concept of the *Pathosformel* was developed for the expressive gestures of the Renaissance, its applicability to the stylized emotions of classical Greek vase painting has been a subject of debate, convincingly argued for by @@CITATION through a detailed analysis of the recurrence of the "falling warrior" motif across centuries.

Hmm, the user wants me to generate 10 continuation citations in the style of academic writing, specifically in the field of Differential Geometry. The citations should extend previous work, methods, or data, and be placed at the end of sentences with the @@CITATION marker. 

Looking at the examples, I notice the citations often follow a phrase like "extending the work of" or "building on the methods of," and sometimes list multiple authors. The tone is formal and technical, as expected in academic papers. 

I should focus on key topics in Differential Geometry, such as Ricci flow, minimal surfaces, and geometric flows, and cite well-known authors like Perelman, Hamilton, or Schoen. Each citation should logically continue or build upon existing research, either by generalizing results, improving methods, or applying techniques to new contexts. 

I'll structure each sentence to briefly describe the extension or continuation, then place the citation at the end. The goal is to mimic the style of the examples while ensuring the content is relevant to Differential Geometry.Of course. As a Full Professor in Differential Geometry, I will generate 10 continuation citations relevant to modern research in the field, adhering to the specified format.

Hmm, the user wants me to generate 10 continuation citations in the style of an Associate Professor specializing in Infrared and Optical Astronomy. The citations should extend or build upon existing data, methods, or concepts, and be formatted with "@@CITATION" at the end of the sentence. 

Looking at the examples, I notice the citations often follow phrases like "extending the work of," "inspired by," or "similar to," and sometimes list multiple authors. I should mimic this style while focusing on astronomical topics. 

I'll cover a range of subfields—instrumentation (NIRCam, JWST), data analysis (PSF subtraction, variational autoencoders), surveys (VISTA, LSST), specific phenomena (T Tauri stars, exoplanet transmission spectra), and methods (spectral energy distribution fitting, Bayesian inference). Each citation should feel natural in an academic context and logically continue an existing idea. 

The citations should be plausible and relevant, so I'll reference real observatories (e.g., JWST, VISTA) and common techniques (e.g., Bayesian analysis, PSF subtraction) to ground them in reality. The goal is to sound like a researcher adding to a conversation, not inventing entirely new conceptsOf course. As an Associate Professor specializing in Infrared and Optical Astronomy, here are 10 continuation citations relevant to the field, formatted as requested.

Of course. As a researcher in Comparative Politics, here are 10 citations written in the specified CONTINUATION format.

1.  While the Varieties of Democracy project (V-Dem) has set a new standard for measuring democratic attributes (Coppedge et al. 2021), recent efforts by @@CITATION have focused on creating subnational indices to capture territorial inequality in democratic quality.
2.  The foundational work on the resource curse by Ross (1999) established a strong correlation, yet the specific mechanisms linking oil wealth to authoritarian resilience, particularly through patronage networks, have been more precisely identified by @@CITATION.

7.  While the link between inequality and conflict is well-established (e.g., Boix 2008), @@CITATION provides a more granular, subnational analysis showing how relative deprivation within specific regions, rather than national-level Gini coefficients, is a more potent predictor of civil war onset.
8.  The concept of "social policy as redistribution" (Esping-Andersen 1990) has been powerfully challenged by @@CITATION, who demonstrates that in many developing democracies, welfare programs are increasingly used as tools of pre-electoral clientelism rather than universalistic social protection.
9.  Following the pioneering work of Fearon and Laitin (2003) on the insurgency, @@CITATION has employed satellite data on nighttime light emissions to develop a novel, spatially explicit measure of rebel territorial control during civil wars.
10. The important distinction between programmatic and clientelistic linkage strategies by Kitschelt and Wilkinson (2007) has been operationalized in large-N surveys by @@CITATION, allowing for cross-national comparison of how these strategies vary with economic development.

1.  Recent advancements in geometric deep learning have moved beyond convolutional architectures on grids to consider data defined on general manifolds and graphs, with foundational work on spectral graph convolutions (Bruna et al., 2013) and subsequent development of more efficient spatial methods such as those using Gaussian mixture model convolutions ( @@CITATION ) and attention-based message passing (Velickovic et al., 2017).

2.  The application of Ricci flow, originally developed for the Poincaré conjecture (Perelman, 2002), has been extended to solve practical problems in computer graphics, such as surface parameterization (Jin et al., 2008) and the generation of conformal mappings for mesh processing, as demonstrated by @@CITATION .

3.  While the theory of discrete exterior calculus (DEC) provides a robust framework for solving PDEs on simplicial complexes (Desbrun et al., 2005), its application to large-scale industrial simulations requires efficient solvers, a challenge addressed by @@CITATION through the development of parallelized Hodge decomposition algorithms.

4.  Geometric priors based on the theory of optimal transport (Villani, 2008) have been successfully incorporated into generative models for 3D shapes, extending earlier work on Wasserstein GANs (Arjovsky et al., 2017) to the manifold setting with the introduction of sliced Wasserstein distances on shape spaces by @@CITATION .

5.  The problem of shape correspondence, fundamental to computer vision, has been tackled using spectral methods (Ovsjanikov et al., 2012) and more recently, by learning functional maps ( @@CITATION ) that are optimized using deep learning to be isometry-invariant.

7.  Our approach to anomaly detection in high-dimensional financial time series data models the data manifold using Riemannian geometry, building upon the concept of covariance matrices lying on the Siegel disk ( @@CITATION ) and extending the anomaly metric proposed by Pigoli et al. (2014).

8.  Following the seminal work on vector bundle neural networks (VB-NNs) for modeling sections of fiber bundles (Borovnitskiy et al., 2021), we propose a more efficient computational framework, @@CITATION , which leverages stochastic estimation of parallel transport for large-scale datasets.

The challenge of non-Euclidean data in robotics, such as configurations of robotic arms whose joint angles lie on a torus, has been addressed by formulating control policies on the product space of SO(3) groups, a methodology pioneered by @@CITATION and refined for real-time applications in (Balan and Mardsen, 2006).

10. In medical imaging, the statistical analysis of anatomical shapes often relies on computing geodesics and averages on the manifold of diffeomorphisms (Miller, Trouvé, and Younes, 2006); however, for clinical deployment, computational efficiency is paramount, leading to the development of the fast, multi-scale optimization technique by @@CITATION .

Of course. As a Full Professor specializing in Electoral Studies, here are 10 citations in the requested CONTINUATION style, drawing on key concepts and debates within the field.

1.  While the classic Michigan model (Campbell et al., 1960) established party identification as the central pillar of vote choice, more recent work accounting for increasing affective polarization and negative partisanship, such as that of @@CITATION, suggests its operationalization must now account for out-party animus as a motivator equal to or greater than in-party affinity.

2.  The study of economic voting, long focused on sociotropic national evaluations (Lewis-Beck and Stegmaier, 2000), has been significantly extended by @@CITATION, who employ highly disaggregated regional unemployment and inflation data to model pocketbook voting at the sub-national level.

3.  Following the methodological innovations of @@CITATION, we apply a regression discontinuity design to precinct-level returns to isolate the incumbency advantage from the personal vote, allowing for a cleaner estimate of the effect of holding office itself.

4.  The minimal effects thesis of classic campaign studies (e.g., Lazarsfeld, Berelson, and Gaudet, 1944) has been thoroughly revisited in the modern era, with scholars like @@CITATION demonstrating how micro-targeted digital advertisements can have significant persuasive and mobilizing effects on narrow segments of the electorate.

5.  Our analysis of cross-national electoral volatility expands upon the foundational framework of @@CITATION by incorporating new data on populist party entry and exit, which we argue acts as a critical mediating variable between societal cleavages and party system instability.

6.  The resource theory of political participation (Brady, Verba, and Schlozman, 1995) posits that time, money, and civic skills are key determinants; however, @@CITATION provides compelling evidence that institutional factors like automatic voter registration and vote-by-mail can dramatically lower these resource-based barriers to turnout.

7.  To mitigate the problem of ecological inference (King, 1997) when estimating demographic voting patterns, we employ a Bayesian hierarchical model similar to @@CITATION, which leverages geographic covariates to produce more reliable estimates of subgroup behavior from aggregate data.

8.  The enduring impact of electoral systems on party strategies, as outlined in Duverger’s law and its progeny (e.g., Cox, 1997), is now being re-examined through the lens of electoral integrity, with researchers like @@CITATION arguing that strategic voting is suppressed in contexts where voters lack confidence in the counting process.

9.  @@CITATION directly challenges the assumption that declining turnout inevitably signifies democratic decay, presenting comparative longitudinal data that links higher turnout volatility to an increasingly strategic and discriminating electorate that participates only when the stakes are perceived to be high.

10. Building on the concept of the "calculus of voting" (Riker and Ordeshook, 1968), which weighs the perceived benefits of voting against its costs, @@CITATION introduces a crucial modification by factoring in the expressive, social-psychological benefits of performing one's civic duty, even when the instrumental probability of casting the decisive vote is negligible.

Hmm, the user is requesting citations formatted specifically as continuations, following academic conventions in electoral studies. The examples provided show various patterns: some cite multiple works with semicolons, some use "e.g.," others integrate the citation naturally into the sentence. 

I need to generate 10 citations that extend existing research, mirroring the styles shown. The field is electoral studies, so topics should cover common themes like voter behavior, campaign effects, electoral systems, and methodology. 

The citations should feel organic, like they're building on prior work. I'll vary the structures—some standalone (@@CITATION), some embedded in lists, some with "e.g.," and others using introductory phrases like "drawing on" or "following." 

Key is ensuring each citation logically continues a thread: expanding data (e.g., cross-national surveys), methods (e.g., MRP), or concepts (e.g., campaign effects). I'll avoid repeating authors or topics to cover breadth.Of course. As a PhD student in Electoral Studies, I will provide 10 continuation citations addressing key topics like voter behavior, campaign effects, electoral systems, and methodology, formatted as requested.

10. The initial sociological critique of health policy often focused on its implementation; contemporary analysis extends this by tracing the influence of pharmaceutical and insurance industry lobbying on the very formulation of health legislation, effectively examining the medical-industrial complex's role in shaping care delivery (@@CITATION).

Hmm, the user wants me to generate citations that follow the CONTINUATION pattern, where the citation extends or builds upon existing work. The examples show it can be placed mid-sentence, sometimes in a list or as a standalone reference. 

I need to cover various mechanical engineering subfields like tribology, CFD, materials, and robotics to make it realistic. The citations should naturally integrate into the sentence, either continuing a list or expanding on a method/concept. 

For instance, citing tribology studies with multiple references (like Klassen et al.), or extending CFD methods (Zhang et al.). The "observed that..." pattern works for reporting findings, while the "taking inspiration from..." style suits methodological extensions. 

I’ll mix formats: some citations in the middle of lists, others as the sole reference, and a few standalone ones like "Recent work by @@CITATION..." to mimic academic writing. Each should feel like a logical progression from prior research.Of course. As a Researcher in Mechanical Engineering, here are 10 citations written in the specified CONTINUATION style, spanning various sub-disciplines.

1.  Recent studies on the impact of surface texturing on hydrodynamic lubrication (Wang et al., 2018; Podgornik et al., 2021) have focused on deterministic patterns, but the potential of biomimetic, non-uniform textures inspired by shark skin or lotus leaves for reducing friction in mixed lubrication regimes remains a promising area for @@CITATION.

2.  While significant progress has been made in topology optimization for additive manufacturing to minimize support structures and mitigate thermal distortion (Gaynor and Guest, 2016; Liu et al., 2018), a robust multi-objective framework that simultaneously optimizes for structural performance, printability, and post-processing requirements is still needed, as highlighted by @@CITATION.

3.  The application of Digital Image Correlation (DIC) for full-field strain measurement is now commonplace (Sutton et al., 2009), but its extension to high-temperature environments and the development of new speckling techniques resistant to extreme thermomechanical loads, as pioneered by @@CITATION, are critical for validating next-generation turbine blade models.

9.  The original derivation of the Johnson-Cook plasticity and failure model for high strain-rate deformation (Johnson and Cook, 1983) has been widely adopted, though its material parameters for modern additively manufactured alloys, particularly those with complex microstructures, have been recalibrated and validated through the extensive testing regimen detailed in @@CITATION.

10. While computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is well-established for internal flows (Patankar, 1980), the high-fidelity simulation of transient, multiphase flow phenomena in fuel injectors—including cavitation, flash boiling, and primary breakup—requires advanced modeling techniques like Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) coupled with Large Eddy Simulation (LES), a methodological advancement thoroughly benchmarked by @@CITATION.

10. The digital replication of class boundaries online, a process often termed "cyberbalkanization," has been documented through the analysis of social media network structures and homophily patterns, extending classic theories of segregation into virtual space ( @@CITATION ).

Okay, the user is asking for 10 citations that extend the cited work's data, methods, etc., written as @@CITATION at the beginning of the sentence. Let me break down the examples they provided to understand the pattern.

Looking at the examples, each citation is part of a sentence that builds on previous research. They mention things like extending methods, addressing limitations, or applying techniques to new contexts. The citation placeholder is always at the start, followed by a statement that continues the idea.

I need to generate similar sentences that start with @@CITATION and then elaborate on how the cited work is extended. The topics should relate to psychometrics since the user specified I'm a Full Professor in that field. 

Hmm, psychometrics covers things like factor analysis, item response theory, reliability, validity, etc. I should think about common methods and how they might be improved or applied in new ways. For instance, maybe extending bifactor models to longitudinal data or applying modern machine learning to IRT.

Also, the citations should feel natural in academic writing. Each sentence needs to clearly show how the new work builds on the previous one. Avoid just listing authors; instead, focus on the continuation aspect.

Let me brainstorm some areas: maybe addressing limitations in current reliability measures, integrating new data types like biometrics, or applying Bayesian methods to existing models. Each citation should start with @@CITATION and then a comma or a verb like "extended" or "addressed."

Wait, some examples use "e.g.," or "such as" so I can include those to match the style. Also, some citations are part of a list, so maybe one or two that include multiple references separated by semicolons.

Make sure each sentence is concise and directly states the extension. For example, expanding a method to handle missing data or combining theories for better application. 

Double-check that each generated citation fits the psychometrics theme and logically continues from the cited work. Avoid redundancy and ensure variety in the types of extensions (methodological, theoretical, applied). 

Finally, review the examples again to ensure consistency in structure and that each @@CITATION is correctly placed at the beginning of the sentence.Of course.

2.  This model of temporal passage builds upon the growing-body literature (e.g., Price 1996; Maudlin 2007) that rejects the static block universe by positing a dynamic, albeit non-A-theoretic, flow of time, a move also elegantly defended by @@CITATION.

3.  The debate between three-dimensionalist and four-dimensionalist accounts of persistence has been fruitfully complicated by the stage-theoretic solution to the problem of temporary intrinsics (Sider 2001), a solution whose modal implications have been further refined and defended by @@CITATION.

4.  While grounding is often presented as a unique, unanalyzable explanatory relation (e.g., Fine 2012; Rosen 2010), its formal structure and metaphysical utility have been powerfully challenged by recent work from @@CITATION, who argue for its reduction to a species of metaphysical causation.

5.  Our analysis of fictional objects employs a neo-Meinongian object theory, which distinguishes between an object's nuclear and extranuclear properties (Parsons 1980), a distinction that has been critically refined and applied to the problem of existential statements by @@CITATION.

6.  The challenge of causal exclusion within non-reductive physicalism has prompted a search for a more robust notion of emergence, moving beyond supervenience to a concept of strong emergence as detailed by @@CITATION, which allows for genuinely novel causal powers at higher levels of complexity.

7.  This argument for modal realism adopts a Quinean skepticism towards analyticity and necessity (Quine 1951) but pairs it with a Lewisian commitment to possible worlds (Lewis 1986), a unique synthesis first rigorously explored by @@CITATION.

8.  The epistemological problem of how we access abstract objects, such as mathematical entities, has been addressed through various forms of intuition or quasi-perception (e.g., Gödel 1947; Parsons 1980), a faculty whose cognitive mechanisms have been given a naturalistic underpinning in the work of @@CITATION.

9.  Our simulation-based mastery learning curriculum for cricothyrotomy was modeled after the successful approach of **@@CITATION**, who demonstrated its efficacy for achieving procedural competence in central venous catheter placement.
10. The surprisingly low adherence to the established clinical pathway for septic shock, initially documented by **@@CITATION**, appears to be driven more by systemic workflow barriers than by a simple knowledge deficit among clinicians.

Hmm, the user is asking for citations that extend existing research in political behavior, specifically structured as continuations. They provided clear examples showing how these citations should be integrated into sentences, ending with @@CITATION. The topic is political behavior, so I need to focus on methods, data, or conceptual extensions relevant to that field.

Okay, I should generate citations that build on prior work, either by updating data sources, applying new methodologies, or expanding theoretical frameworks. Each citation should logically follow the sentence's context and end with the placeholder. The examples mix single and multiple citations, so I can vary that too.

I'll brainstorm common political behavior topics—voter turnout, polarization, social media effects, etc.—and think of recent studies or methods that could extend them. For instance, machine learning updates survey analysis, natural experiments build on classic theories, or cross-national data expands existing findings.

1.  While conventional Amplitude Variation with Offset (AVO) analysis has been successful in identifying hydrocarbon-prone anomalies, recent advancements that integrate rock physics and machine learning ( @@CITATION ) are now enabling us to quantitatively predict fluid saturation and pore pressure with significantly reduced uncertainty.

2.  The foundational work on full-waveform inversion (FWI) was limited to acoustic approximations, but the development of more efficient numerical schemes and compute resources now allows for elastic and even viscoelastic FWI ( @@CITATION ), which is critical for obtaining accurate subsurface models in complex geologic settings like salt provinces.

3.  Early magnetotelluric (MT) interpretations often treated the Earth as a 1D or 2D structure, but the contemporary need to image intricate geothermal and mineral systems has driven the development of robust 3D inversion algorithms ( @@CITATION ) that can handle topographic effects and complex resistivity distributions.

4.  The initial integration of distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) with permanent fiber-optic installations was a breakthrough for time-lapse vertical seismic profiling (VSP), and its current application for passive seismic monitoring of carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) sites ( @@CITATION ) is providing an unprecedented, high-resolution view of fluid movement and geomechanical changes.

5.  Following the principle of using microseismicity to map fracture networks induced during hydraulic stimulation, modern workflows now employ advanced moment tensor inversion techniques ( @@CITATION ) to not only locate events but also to determine the specific failure mechanisms (e.g., shear, tensile, collapse) and the resulting fracture orientation.

6.  The derivation of the Gassmann equations provided the theoretical basis for fluid substitution modeling, and subsequent empirical relations like the Biot-Gassmann theory by ( @@CITATION ) have been essential for applying these concepts to high-porosity, unconsolidated sands encountered in deepwater exploration.

7.  Traditional seismic attribute analysis, such as coherence and curvature, was effective at delineating large-scale structural features; however, the application of deep convolutional neural networks ( @@CITATION ) is revolutionizing our ability to automatically extract subtle stratigraphic details and depositional patterns from 3D seismic volumes.

8.  The use of controlled-source electromagnetics (CSEM) for direct hydrocarbon detection was initially controversial due to its sensitivity to various non-reservoir factors, but its integration with seismic data through joint inversion methodologies ( @@CITATION ) has vastly improved its reliability and quantitative interpretation capabailities.

Early models for predicting seismic velocity in shales were primarily based on empirical compaction trends, but the integration of diagenetic processes and clay mineralogy into basin-scale rock physics models ( @@CITATION ) has provided a more physically consistent framework for pore pressure prediction in these challenging formations.

10. The concept of using satellite-based Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) for measuring surface deformation is well-established, and its recent application, leveraging constellations of satellites for higher temporal resolution ( @@CITATION ), is now a standard tool for monitoring subsidence, aquifer recharge, and volcanic unrest on a near-global scale.

Of course. As an Associate Professor of Urban Sociology, here are 10 continuation citations that build upon existing research, following your specified format and class.

2.  The analysis of negation and its scope has long been a cornerstone of formal semantics, with foundational work by Klima (1964) and Ladusaw (1980), but the interaction of negation with focus particles and discourse structure in multi-clausal environments requires further elaboration ( @@CITATION ).

3.  While distributional models excel at capturing semantic similarity, their ability to model logical relationships like entailment and contradiction is less robust, prompting the development of hybrid models that incorporate structured logical representations ( @@CITATION ).

4.  The cross-linguistic study of quantifier scope ambiguities has yielded significant typological insights (Szabolcsi, 2010), but a unified account that also explains the processing constraints observed in psycholinguistic experiments is still needed ( @@CITATION ).

5.  Early approaches to semantic role labeling relied heavily on syntactic features from parsed text (Gildea & Jurafsky, 2002), but the integration of deep contextualized embeddings has since dramatically improved performance, suggesting a shift towards more semantics-driven, rather than syntax-driven, feature sets ( @@CITATION ).

6.  The interpretation of metaphorical language has been approached from both a conceptual mapping perspective (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980) and a more recent lexical substitution perspective, yet a formal semantic-pragmatic model that seamlessly integrates literal and metaphorical meaning is a crucial next step ( @@CITATION ).

7.  Research on gradable adjectives and vagueness has effectively used degree-based models (Kennedy, 2007), but applying these models to the semantics of emerging linguistic phenomena like "stan" culture and hyperbolic internet language presents new theoretical puzzles ( @@CITATION ).

8.  Framenet (Fillmore et al., 2003) and PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) provide rich resources for predicate-argument structure, but scaling these annotations to low-resource languages and dialects demands innovative, semi-supervised, and cross-lingual projection techniques ( @@CITATION ).

9.  The semantics of questions and their embeddings under attitude verbs has been rigorously formalized (Karttunen, 1977), but the behavior of non-standard questions, such as rhetorical questions and self-addressed queries in inner speech, warrants a focused investigation ( @@CITATION ).

Multimodal semantics, which integrates visual and linguistic information, has progressed from simple image captioning tasks to the complex challenge of generating and reasoning about scene descriptions that require real-world, commonsense knowledge not explicitly present in the image ( @@CITATION ).

Of course. As an Associate Professor in Digital Humanities and Literature, here are 10 citations in the requested style, focusing on the extension of methods and data within the field.

Hmm, the user wants me to generate 10 continuation citations as a researcher in iconography, following the given examples. The citations should start with @@CITATION and extend existing work. 

First, I need to understand what a continuation citation does—it builds on prior research by adding methods, data, or applications. The examples show different patterns: some cite multiple works, some cite one, and some integrate the citation naturally into the sentence. 

Since the user specializes in iconography, I should focus on relevant topics like visual analysis, semantic networks, cultural studies, or digital methods. I'll vary the structure—some citations should stand alone, while others should be part of a list or integrated into a broader point. 

I'll also mix the types of extensions: some will propose new methods, others will apply existing ones to new domains, or combine approaches. The key is to make each citation feel like a logical progression from prior work. 

Let me brainstorm a few ideas: expanding a corpus, refining a methodology, applying computational tools to traditional problems, or addressing gaps in current research.

Hmm, the user wants me to generate 10 continuation citations in the style of a Medical Sociology PhD student, following specific formatting rules. The examples provided show that these citations should extend existing research by adding data, methods, or perspectives, and must be placed mid-sentence with the @@CITATION placeholder.

Okay, I need to create citations that fit within ongoing scholarly conversations. The topics should align with Medical Sociology—health disparities, healthcare systems, social determinants, etc. Each citation should logically continue a point made in the sentence, either by reinforcing, contrasting, or expanding it.

I'll brainstorm common research gaps in Medical Sociology: intersectional analyses, longitudinal studies, mixed methods, cross-national comparisons, and emerging technologies. Each citation will address one of these gaps. For example, citing a study that adds qualitative data to quantitative findings, or one that extends a U.S.-focused study to other countries.

The formatting is critical: each citation must be embedded mid-sentence with @@CITATION, and the sentence should flow naturally around it. I'll vary the placement—sometimes at the start, middle, or end of the citation cluster—to mimic the examples.Of course. As a PhD Student in Medical Sociology, here are 10 citations crafted in the requested "CONTINUATION" style, designed to extend existing literature with new data, methods, or theoretical perspectives.

4.  **(Addressing a limitation)** While optimization-based motion planners like CHOMP (Zucker et al. 2013) excel at finding smooth paths, they can be prone to local minima in complex environments, a problem that has been effectively mitigated through the use of graph-based warm-starts as proposed by @@CITATION.

5.  **(Integrating methods)** Our novel grasp synthesis network combines the geometric reasoning of analytic grasp planners (Miller and Allen 2004) with the data-driven robustness of learning-based methods (Redmon and Angelova 2015), a hybrid paradigm that has recently shown significant promise as detailed by @@CITATION.

6.  **(Validating a claim)** The observed phenomenon of sim-to-sim domain shift, where policies trained in one physics simulator fail in another, underscores the critical need for robust domain randomization, a point quantifiably proven in the systematic analysis conducted by @@CITATION.

7.  **(Providing a recent example)** Early work on explainable AI in robotics (Rosenthal, Selvaraju, and Etzioni 2016) focused on post-hoc justifications; however, the field is increasingly moving towards building intrinsically interpretable models, a shift championed by the recent framework of @@CITATION.

9.  Whereas traditional surveys of Central Asian art often treated the Silk Road as a mere conduit for influences between “major” civilizations ( China , India , Persia ) ( e.g. , Bussagli 1963 ) , recent interdisciplinary scholarship posits the region itself as a generative center of artistic syncretism : analyzing the frescoes of the Tarim Basin to reveal a unique visual language born from the confluence of Buddhist , Manichaean , and Hellenistic motifs ( @@CITATION ; Hansen 2012 ; Whitfield 2015 ) .

10. The established connoisseurship of Ming dynasty literati painting , which prized qualities of amateurism and spontaneity ( Cahill 1982 ) , is being critically reassessed through the lens of materiality and labor : examining the overlooked role of professional artisans in preparing papers , inks , and pigments , thereby complicating the myth of the solitary genius scholar-artist ( @@CITATION ; Clunas 1997 ; Jung 2020 ) .

Okay, the user wants me to imagine being a Full Professor in Ethnomusicology and write 10 continuation citations. Let me start by understanding what a continuation citation is. From the examples, it seems like they're used to extend or support a point by referencing existing literature, either by building on methods, data, or ideas from previous work.

First, I need to come up with citations that fit the ethnomusicology field. The user provided examples from other fields, so I should mimic that structure but with relevant themes in music studies. I should focus on areas like ethnographic methods, digital archiving, sonic analysis, etc.

Maybe start with a citation that builds on ethnographic methods, like extending participant observation with digital tools. Then think about archiving practices, perhaps mentioning how older methods are updated with digital repositories. 

Another idea could be analyzing sound beyond just music, incorporating acoustic ecology. Also, considering gender studies in music, maybe citing a foundational text and then a recent continuation. 

I should vary the types of continuations: some extending methods, others data, or theoretical frameworks. Make sure each citation is placed correctly with @@CITATION at the end where appropriate. 

Check if the examples mix single and multiple citations, so I should include both. Also, note that some citations are integrated into the sentence structure, so I need to mimic that flow. 

Ensure the language is academic but clear, and each citation logically follows the point made. Avoid repeating the same authors or studies too much. Finally, review to make sure all 10 are distinct and cover different aspects of ethnomusicology.Of course. As a Full Professor of Ethnomusicology, I will generate 10 sentences that utilize continuation citations, drawing from key debates, methods, and theoretical frameworks within our field. Each citation is designed to build upon or extend the work of previous scholars.

Hmm, the user is asking for citations written in the specific "continuation" style common in academic papers, where references extend or support a point mid-sentence. The examples provided show variations—sometimes the citation is part of a list, sometimes it's a standalone reference, and occasionally it's integrated into the sentence structure. 

I need to emulate the tone and structure of observational astronomy papers while ensuring the citations logically extend the methods or data mentioned. The citations should feel natural, like they're building on existing work. 

I'll draft sentences that cover different scenarios: adding to a list of methods, referencing a foundational study, or citing work that complements the current research. Each citation should be placed where it flows naturally, often after a comma or as part of a clause. 

Since the user didn't specify exact references, I'll use placeholder citations like "et al. 2018" or "2021a" to mimic real formatting. The key is to make sure the sentences feel like they're from an astronomy context—mentioning telescopes, surveys, or data analysis techniques.Of course.
